# FailureAnalyzerFDM

A software that analyse effects of loading on a 3D printed model.

This should only be used as a guidiance of the upper boundary in the elastic regime

This should be used to analysis case where bending moment and transverse force are in dominant position, as the effect of elongation due to tension and compression is deglected in the displacement analysis.
